# Team Norms

Team Members: Anika, Kavya, Kenisha, Lawrence, Owen, Wenxuan

## 1. Update progress often

- If you feel like you are falling behind, let the team know. Being open and honest is better, so that we can help each other if necessary.

## 2. Ask Questions

- Questions are better to be asked early. If you wait too long to ask questions about small problems, bigger problems can evolve.

## 3. Designating Tasks

- Designating tasks is helpful in keeping the project organized. If there are no assigned tasks, people may unknowingly work on the same things by accident.

## 4. Show up

- It is important to show up to classes and meetings on time so that we can complete our tasks in a timely manner. If people are late/missing it may make things harder for other people, and can slow down progress.
