## Scribed Discussion:
We started by introudcing ourselves to the group. We then all took a look at the Sec01 assignment and came up with a plan to complete it. We worked down the list and were able to assign group roles, create a set of group norms/rules, and discussed our app idea a little further. We concluded that our app is going to be a shopping list app that allows families/roomates to add groceries to a shared shopping list. This is helpful because it allows people living together to always be stocked on essentials like toilet paper, dish soap, etc. It could also be used to track the costs of these essentials to ensure that costs are evenly split.
