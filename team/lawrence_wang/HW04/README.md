The code that I focused on evaluating is shown in the 4 pictures here.  
The test results I got are found in the respective folders for each of the code portions I was assigned to:    
  
**Create Account**  
**Log In**  
**Sign Out**  
**Delete Account**  
**Update Profile Info**  

Inside these folders are images that show the proper alert messages whenever a respective action is done as well as proper error messages for actions that should fail
