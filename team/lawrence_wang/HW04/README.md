The code that I focused on evaluating is shown in the 4 pictures of this HW04 folder  
The test results I got are found using **Live Testing** in the **HW04_TestResults** folder, where there are folders for each of the code portions I was assigned to:  
  
**Create Account**  
**Log In**  
**Sign Out**  
**Delete Account**  
**Update Profile Info**  

Inside these folders are images that show the proper alert messages whenever a respective action is done as well as proper error messages for actions that should fail
