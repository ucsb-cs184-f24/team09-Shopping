Hi! I am Wenxuan Xu. I am currently in my fourth year pursuing Applied Mathematics and Computer Science degree. 

I was born in China, where I had my education till high school. I originally was attracted by the beauty and elegance of the math world, but since I get in touch with Computer Science, I feel there is something shared between these two majors. The strick logic is what I pursue and with Compter Science, I can achieve much more things by my own. I have soon been enjoying developing software and websites. CS 184 is a challenging course, but I hope we can have fun during our development.

Besides studying, I love hunting for delicious food around where I live. I know many good restaurants near UCSB or Santa Barbara downtown, so I am happy to give some suggestions if you cannot decide what to eat!
