In HW04b, I implemented a summary page where the user can get a summary of previous purchased items of their households.
Users can select the household they joined, and see two graphs:
- First one is a histogram, showing the total amount of money they spent in weekly/montly/yearly periods.
- Second one is a pie chart, representing the cost each category is taking, also in last week/month/year periods.
