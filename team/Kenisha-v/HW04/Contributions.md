## 1. Product Backlog

I worked on the product backlog by collaborating with team members to gather, define, and prioritize user stories. This ensured we had a structured list of features and tasks to work on for our HW04 meeting.

## 2. Design Documentation

In the design phase, I played a significant role in conceptualizing the systemâ€™s architecture, ensuring all components were well-defined and consistent with the overall plan. I contributed detailed design diagrams and worked on the flowcharts for the relationships between modules.

## 3. User Manual

The user manual was crafted to guide end-users in effectively using our product. It provides step-by-step instructions for installation and accessing core features. I made sure that the language was simple and accessible, catering to non-technical users as well. The manual also includes a troubleshooting section to assist users in resolving common issues independently.

## 4. RETRO_2 (Sprint Retrospective 2)

For RETRO_2, I documented our sprint retrospective discussion, highlighting the successes and identifying challenges we faced. I provided key recommendations for improving our workflow in the next sprint, which included enhancing team communication during the testing phase. The retrospective notes included actionable improvements that the team could follow to improve efficiency.
