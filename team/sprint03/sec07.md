## Scribed Discussion:
We began our meeting by discussing an issue with our current homescreen. We currently don't know why it is malfunctioning and will look further into it. We also discussed 
possible features for HW04 such as a summary screen where users will be able to see a summary of their spendings. We also discussed how we should write tests for our app.
Finally, we started MANUAL.md and DESIGN.md, and discussed what we want to do for that.
