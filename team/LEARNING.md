I have prior experience with React Native but I mainly worked on the Google Authentication side of it. I have a lot of experience with UI and I am looking forward to learning how to create a shared account space for this app so that multiple people can upload things to the same "house" shopping list.

I have taken CS 156 which made me briefly familiar with web/app development. I know the basics of JavaScript which will hopefully come in handy with with React Native. I am interested in web developement and am hoping to learn more about it this quarter.
