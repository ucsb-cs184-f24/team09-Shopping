## Retro Assessment

* We began by discussing what we wanted to implement in our project, reviewing the feedback we received from the last section.

* The retrospective went well! We discussed the issues we plan to address moving forward.

* My advice is to keep discussions open while actively encouraging more diverse input. Ensure everyone has a chance to speak, as this can bring new perspectives and lead to more creative solutions to overcome challenges.

## Retro Outcomes

We agreed to implement the feedback from the last section, focusing on improving communication during meetings. We also committed to prioritizing the key issues identified during the retrospective and ensuring all team members have an opportunity to contribute ideas, fostering a more inclusive discussion environment.
