## Retro Assessment

* We started by checking who was present, then jumped into discussing action items. The focus was on figuring out how to get issues done faster, improve communication using Discord/Slack, and track progress by seeing how quickly we close out tasks. Each person shared their thoughts on whatâ€™s been going well and what we could improve.

* Overall, the retro went pretty well! Everyone who attended was engaged, and we had some good discussions about where we can improve. Communication and making sure that tasks are assigned and closed on time were the main points, and everyone seemed onboard with those changes.
  
* My advice would be to keep things open for discussion but actively encourage more diverse input. Also, make sure everyone gets a chance to speak, as this helps bring in new perspectives, and it could lead to more creative ways of overcoming any problems.
