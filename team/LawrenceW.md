Hello everyone! I am a current 4th year CS Major. I recently was an IT Intern over the summer, and look forward to gaining more expertise in software engineering and the development process as a whole with this team.  

Outside of school I enjoy working out, playing basketball, and playing the keyboard for a potential band with my friends
