### Scenario

**Persona:**
Joe is a UCSB college student who has 4 roomates. He has a strict budget and has specific dietary restrictions when it comes to grocery shopping. He doesn't have a car, which can make it tough to grocery shop sometimes. He has a very busy schedule as he is taking many tough computer science classes.

**Trigger Event**:
Dish soap and paper towels are about to run out and he wants to remind his roomates to buy some the next time they go to the store. He also doesn't have much time to run to grocery this week because he has a lot of assignments. He is running out of meal prep and ingredients in his fridge. It is hard to concentrate during class because he is hungry, but doesn't have much food to eat. Eating out is not really an option for him, because of his strict budget.

Resolution:
Joe opens up his shared shopping app because he knows one of his roomates is running grocery later today. He adds food and shared items like dish soap to the app shopping list. Later that day, his roomate is able to pick up the groceries that Joe needs, and he is able to cook food. Also, his apartment is now restocked on essentials like dish soap or paper towels, so he doesn't have to worry about that.
