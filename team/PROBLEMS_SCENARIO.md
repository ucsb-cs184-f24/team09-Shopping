### Scenario

**Persona:**
Joe is a UCSB college student who has 4 roomates. He has a strict budget and has specific dietary restrictions when it comes to grocery shopping. He doesn't have a car, which can make it tough to grocery shop sometimes. He has a very busy schedule as he is taking many tough computer science classes.

**Trigger Event**:
Dish soap and paper towels are about to run out and he wants to remind his roomates to buy some the next time they go to the store. He also doesn't have much time to run to grocery this week because he has a lot of assignments. He is running out of meal prep and ingredients in his fridge. It is hard to concentrate during class because he is hungry, but doesn't have much food to eat. Eating out is not really an option for him, because of his strict budget.
