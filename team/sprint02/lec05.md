## Scribed Discussion:
In our Sprint Planning meeting, we discussed possible user stories necessary to have an MVP. This included having a way to login to our app, a way to create a household for the app, a way to create a grocery list for a household, and a way to add items to the grocery list. To tackle these user stories, we discussed how we would actually accomplish these tasks through several issues. We agreed that we would use Firebase for the login/backend for our app. Also, we discussed that we should create UI components such as a login screen, grocery list screen, etc. as well.
