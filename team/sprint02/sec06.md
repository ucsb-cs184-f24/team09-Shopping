## Completed Agenda:
1. Discussed when we want to do our HW04 planning meeting, Retro, and MVP Feedback meeting.
2. Completed HW04 planning meeting.

## Scribed Discussion:
We discussed our plan for the three meetings we need to accomplish for sec06. We decided that today, we are going to 
have our HW04 planning meeting so that we can get started on it. We each reviewed our assigned topic assignment. 
We came up with some initial ideas of things we want to implement. We also assigned each other assessment partners.
For people who have the same topic assignment, we made them assessment partners since they will both have similar tasks
and can better evaluate each other.
