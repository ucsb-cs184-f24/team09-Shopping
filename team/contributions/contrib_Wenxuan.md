- Implement a filter feature for the shopping list. Users can filter out the list items by category. The category list options are dynamicly updated with the shopping list.
- Implement the edit/delete functionality. Users can swipe left on each shopping list and choose to edit or delete each item.
- Build a Summary page where users can see an overview of all the items they purchased in the households. Users can set the summary period to weekly/monthly/yearly and get a detailed histogram and pie chart representing the cost they spent and cost ratio on differen categories.
