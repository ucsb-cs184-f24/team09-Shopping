## Plan:
Our app is intended to provide a way for families and roomates to have shared grocery list. It will act like a basic grocery list, with the ability to check off items. We also plan to add features that can track the cost of certain items so that items can be evenly and fairly split. There will be categories to seperate certain items like, groceries, essentials, bills, and more.

## User Roles:
This app has one type of user: a member of a household looking to create a grocery list and add items to a grocery list.
